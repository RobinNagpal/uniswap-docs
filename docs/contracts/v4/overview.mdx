# Uniswap V4 - Hooks

Welcome to the Uniswap V4 developer documentation.

The new version of Uniswap i.e. V4 is designed to revolutionize how liquidity is provided and how tokens are traded 
on-chain, aiming to expand the horizons of decentralized trading.  The project invites and encourages community 
participation, offering a platform for developers and enthusiasts to contribute to this groundbreaking iteration of 
the Uniswap Protocol.

One of the key innovations in Uniswap v4 is the introduction of "hooks." These are contracts that operate at various 
stages in a pool action's lifecycle, allowing for unprecedented customization. 

Pool creators can now opt for the same tradeoff decisions as in v3 or explore new functionalities. For instance, 
Uniswap v4 pools can support dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders, or function as a time-weighted average market maker 
(TWAMM) to distribute large orders over time. The architectural changes, including a new "singleton" contract where 
all pools exist within a single smart contract, further enhance the platform's efficiency and cost-effectiveness. 

This combination of hooks and the singleton architecture is expected to create a powerful and versatile platform, 
offering fast, safe, and efficient customization and routing across various pools.


Note: V4 is still in development and there are still changes being made to the contracts. We will update the docs as we go.
